MESSAGE_TASK    = "whisper ooc group Don't forget to grab your Reim task. If you haven't grabbed one, feel free to go back out through the mist and once returned to where you came from, you'll REIM CAMP CONFIRM twice. From here you'll go into the structure and GET BOARD."

If you do not wish to have an automated attack, we do ask that you run ;TREIM NONE so that we can at least know your current progress as the script will report status when prompted by the group leader."

MESSAGE_SPAM    = "whisper ooc group As our group can get rather large, a few tips to help screen scroll and lag. Disable Stormfront links by pressing ALT+L on your keyboard. Disable your Room window. You can also run the squelching/condensing scripts ;briefcombat & ;spellmerge to reduce screen scroll. ;no_mstrike to squelch mstrike spam. To not miss speech, consider OPENING the SPEECH window as well."

MESSAGE_THRONE  = "whisper ooc group Inside the throne room, HoA will announce the order in which everyone will summon and attack the Emperor & Empress. Please do not touch the sphere or attack until your name has been called. This ensures everyone gets to loot the Emperor and Empress for their own loot."
MESSAGE_THRONE2 = "whisper ooc group FYI, we will gather at the conclusion of tonight at GC (Gardenia Commons). If you cannot get to GC due to not being premium, please let me or another officer know so that we can coordinate a runner for your share. We will wait a minimum of 5 minutes once we leave the throne room for everyone to gather at GC for the loot split. It is your responsibility to be attentive, make your way to GC, and to join the group leader. Thank you."
